## üîç How to Use These Guides

### Quick Start Path (For Beginners)
If you're new to Hyperware development, follow this path:
1. **[00-QUICK-REFERENCE](./00-QUICK-REFERENCE.md)** - Learn the critical rules (10 min)
2. **[08-MANIFEST-AND-DEPLOYMENT](./08-MANIFEST-AND-DEPLOYMENT.md)** - Understand how apps work (5 min)
3. **[09-CAPABILITIES-GUIDE](./09-CAPABILITIES-GUIDE.md)** - Know what you can access (10 min)
4. **[01-COMMON-PATTERNS](./01-COMMON-PATTERNS.md)** - Copy patterns for your features (reference as needed)
5. **[07-COMPLETE-EXAMPLES](./07-COMPLETE-EXAMPLES.md)** - See full working apps (study one similar to yours)

### Building a New App
1. Start with **QUICK-REFERENCE** to understand the rules
2. Read **MANIFEST-AND-DEPLOYMENT** to understand how apps are installed
3. Review **CAPABILITIES-GUIDE** to know what your app can access
4. Check **COMPLETE-EXAMPLES** for a similar app pattern
5. Use **COMMON-PATTERNS** for specific features
6. Refer to **WIT-TYPES** for data modeling
7. Check **TROUBLESHOOTING** when errors occur

### Adding P2P Features
1. Read **P2P-PATTERNS** thoroughly
2. Start with basic request-response pattern
3. Test with multiple nodes early
4. Use **TESTING-DEBUGGING** for P2P test scenarios

### Fixing Errors
1. Check **TROUBLESHOOTING** first
2. Look for your error message
3. Follow the diagnostic steps
4. Use **TESTING-DEBUGGING** if needed

## üö® Most Common Mistakes to Avoid

1. **Missing `_request_body` parameter** in HTTP endpoints
   - Solution: See QUICK-REFERENCE section 1

2. **Missing `/our.js` script** in HTML
   - Solution: See QUICK-REFERENCE section 2

3. **Using object format** instead of tuples for parameters
   - Solution: See QUICK-REFERENCE section 3

4. **No timeout** on remote requests
   - Solution: See QUICK-REFERENCE section 4

5. **Using HashMap** or other unsupported types
   - Solution: See WIT-TYPES guide

## üìä Decision Trees

### "My build is failing"
```
Check TROUBLESHOOTING Section 1: Build Errors
‚Üì
Still failing? Check QUICK-REFERENCE for common fixes
‚Üì
Type-related? Check WIT-TYPES guide
‚Üì
Import issues? Check TROUBLESHOOTING "ambiguous imports"
```

### "My P2P calls aren't working"
```
Check P2P-PATTERNS for correct syntax
‚Üì
Check TROUBLESHOOTING Section 3: P2P Issues
‚Üì
Add debug logging (see TESTING-DEBUGGING)
‚Üì
Test with local nodes first
```

## üí° Pro Tips for AI Models

1. **Always validate** your understanding by checking the examples
2. **Copy working patterns** rather than creating from scratch
3. **Test incrementally** - don't write everything before testing
4. **Use type-safe patterns** - avoid `any` types
5. **Handle errors gracefully** - users need feedback
6. **Design for offline** - nodes can disconnect
7. **Keep state minimal** - less to sync and debug

## üîó External Resources

- The `example-apps` folder contains working applications
- The skeleton app is your starting template
- Build with `kit b --hyperapp`
- Test with `kit s`

## üìù Guide Maintenance

These guides are based on observed patterns and common issues. Key sources:
- Working example apps (especially samchat)
- Common build errors and their fixes
- P2P communication patterns that work
- Type system limitations and workarounds

When in doubt, refer to the working examples in `example-apps/` folder.

Remember: The skeleton app is designed to compile and run immediately. Start there and modify incrementally, testing at each step.
